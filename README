Just a place for me to learn a bit of rust.

I started with the online rust book https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ (which can also be generated with "rustup doc", cool!).

I'll probably intermix working in that book and doing Advent of Code problems.

What I like:
* cargo new, run, check
* immutable by default
* UTF8 by default
* char is UTF8 character and that's explicitly different from u8
* 'arms' as a descriptor for if-check and match pathways
* break counter * 2;
* loop
* built-in .rev()
* _
* references are immutable by default

Dislikes:
* No compile-time checking of array bounds, it's all run-time. And here I thought rust was about memory safety.
* No compile-time type system. (if you want to understand a type, suggestions online are to force a compiler error to give you type info...)
* Can't print tuples or arrays.
* Lack of simple "for k,v in a" instead it's "for k,v in a.iter().enumerate()"

Looks promising:
* crate system for depedency management
* match (this'll take some time to get used to)
* destructuring
* copy vs move as core feature (move by default)

Confused by:
* ()
